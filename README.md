👋 Hi, I'm @Roushlfy!

🎓 I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University (2021-2025). I had the privilege to join an exchange program at the University of Toronto from September 2023 to December 2023.

💡 My primary area of interest is utilizing machine learning for combinatorial optimization. I'm also interested in the fields of operations research, Markov decision processes, and stochastic programming.

💌 Feel free to reach out to me at xiong-zx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn or xiongzhixiao88@gmail.com.
